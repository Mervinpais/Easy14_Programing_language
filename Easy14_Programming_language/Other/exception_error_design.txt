errorCode = the Error code
errorName = What the error is
errorDescription = What the error is
(NOT USED) errorSolution = How to fix the error
lineNum = the line on which the error occured in
file = the file which the error occured in

===

this design looks good

ERROR {errorCode}; {errorName}: {errorDescription}
---

this looks better

EXCEPETION {errorCode}; {errorName}: {errorDescription}
---

best i think

EXCEPTION ERROR {errorCode}; 
Error {errorName} was thrown at line {lineNum} in File {file}:
{errorDescription}
