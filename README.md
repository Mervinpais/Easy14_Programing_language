# Known Issues

~None :) atleast as of now~
When using print statemnts(in the intractive console/not), there is a bug which is just a silly issue which is that an if statement to check if the parament is a string has an ")" or ");", but before in the code, the code removes those stuff so it causes issue with "syntax error"

===Code===
print("Test stuff");

===Output===
Syntax Error!, your syntax is not correct!
at line 1
at line print("Test stuff");

### This is Causes many bugs with the print statement

- A Fix will be coming soon, probably in version 2.1, if not, me dum and didnt fix it

## Fixed Bug!
### (This bug has been fixed)

I cant list them here as it would be too long but atleast 12(now 11 due to a new one) bugs have been fixed

# Why are there bugs?!

Bruh do you expect a single person to get all the bugs? Lower your expectations dude
