### Console.print()

```csharp
Console.print("Hello World");
```

we can remove the unnecessary "Console" part of our code by add a using statement at the top

```csharp
using Console;

print("Hello world");
```

You can also print arithmetic operations (only one at a time though :(

```csharp
print(1+2);

//Works

print(1+4-2);

//Wont work :(
```

You can do +, -, *, /, % (Modulo), and == in a print statement

//also works :)
```
