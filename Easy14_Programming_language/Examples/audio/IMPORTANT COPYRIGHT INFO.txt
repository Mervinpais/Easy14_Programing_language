COPYRIGHT (C) The song "Candyland" by Tobu is a catchy and upbeat tune that I used as a background music for my example project in my programming language. I wanted to show how the language can play music and sound with ease and flexibility. However, I do not own the rights to this song and I am not affiliated with Tobu or any of his partners. This song is the property of Tobu and his label, NoCopyrightSounds. You can find more information about Tobu and his music on his website, YouTube channel, and social media platforms. I hope you enjoy the song and the project, but please respect the original artist and his work :)
