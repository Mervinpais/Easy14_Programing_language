	<h1>The Syntax Update (Reforms) (During Version 3.1's Development)</h1>
	<h2>1. Reintroducing Parentheses!</h2>
	<p>The new and "improved" syntax during the early stages of 3.1's development were weird to say the least. Take a look at the difference between the old and new syntax for a print statement:</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Old Design</h2>
	<code>Console.print("Hello world!"); // Similar to C# and easier to understand for other programmers :D</code>
	<br>
	<h2>Proposed New</h2>
	<code>Console Print "Hello"; // WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?!?!?</code>
	<p>Now, I have remade the "new" syntax into a better version of the old syntax while being less worse than the new syntax:</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Updated Final</h2>
	<code>Console.Print("Hello world!");</code>
