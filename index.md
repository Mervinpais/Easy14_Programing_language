An easy language for beginners?! wOW iTs NoT lIkE pYthOn ExIsTs (seriously though, try python first, it may be easier than this, this language is if you wanted to, say go from python to something more Object oriented)

* * *


Code Example

```csharp
//Syntax highlighted code block

Console.print("You can't use a print statement without a Console. if you didn't import the Console");

using Console;

print("Hello Coders! or whatever that funny starter Hello world stater project said..");
```
FAQ

* * *

Will This language support One-Liner Code?
No sadly i wont do that as my language does the "Scratch" way of execution by running from top to down and you can't have other lines(statments) within one line I Might add it later, there is/was some code still left over from an attempt in the Console.Print if statement ;)

Will this be a general purpose language?

Not yet, there are still bugs needed to be fixed before it because general purpose

What is the syntax for loops?

```csharp
if (a == b)
{
    //code
}
```

though i may add () in the condition part, i am just too focused on fixing bugs first
