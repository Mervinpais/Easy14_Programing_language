## Reporting a Vulnerability ⚠️

If an issue is found, please report it in issues, if you want to, you can also email me (though i dont look at my inbox alot)
If a problem related to compatablity is found, please report it

## IMPORTANT ❕
Make sure you have C# is installed to use this scripting language!

| Operation system  | Supported |
| ----------------  | --------- |
|  Windows 10/11    |    🙂✔️  |
|  Windows 7        |    😭❌ (.NET 6 & .NET 7 not supported on Windows 7) |
|  Mac OS           |    😐❔  | 
|  Linux            |    🤔✔️ (Note that some features are windows only, in C#, so there may be bugs for linux)  |

The Operating system's mentioned here are the ones i want to support and other operating systems won't be supported because this (programming) language is not really widespread and useful

<s>Note for windows 7, i will make versions for them using .net 5 but some features wont be avaliable due to an older runtime</s>

Windows 7 support will be gone, Rest In Peace, Beloved Windows 7 🪦
