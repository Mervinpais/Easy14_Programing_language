### Summary

* Maybe General purpose?
* Runs on C# (+ Roslyn for C#)
* Python for other stuff

---


<!---# Version 1.0

## New stuff;

* Replaced the old "if (keyword) then keyword_function" with a basic AST
* Fixed Bugs 🪲🛠️
* Better Syntax
  - Before
    ```
    Console.print("Hello world!");
    ```
  - After
    ```
    Console Print "Hello world!";
    ```

    It may look like a downgrade but it's best to keep the code simpler to remeber (and easier to fix bugs with 🥲)

## Known Issues

- None
## Fixed Bugs

> Fixed Console Namespace functions

before any Console._myfunction()_ would not work due to older code compatibilty

Now they have been (mostly) fixed
