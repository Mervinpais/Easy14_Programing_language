# Basic Functions

## Console.print()

Console.print() is used to print stuff to the screen

```
Console.print("Hello World");
```
we can remove the unnessary "Console" part of our code by add a using statement at the top
```
using Console;
print("Hello world");
```

You can also print arithmetic operations (only one at a time though :(
```
print(1+2);
//Works
print(1+4-2);
//Wont work :(
```

You can do +, -, *, /, % (Modulo), and == in a print statement
