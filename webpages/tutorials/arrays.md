# Arrays
<div id="warn">

</div>

Arrays dont currently exist but you can use the += operator in variables to add them to the file [click here to understand how variables are stored](https://mervinpais.github.io/Easy14_Programing_language/webpages/tutorials/howDoesEasy14MakeVariables.html)
```csharp
var myArray = "this is item 1";
myArray += "this is item 2";
myArray += "this is item 3";
```

## Notice; Arrays are still not done so you can't do some stuff in other more better programming languages

More info coming soon
