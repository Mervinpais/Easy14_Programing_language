# The Systax Update (Reforms) (During Version 3.1's Development)

## 1. Reintroducing Parenthesises!

### The New and "Improved" syntax during the early stages of 3.1's Development were.. weird to say the least, just a take a look for a print statement with old and new syntax
<br>

## Old 😀👍

```C#
    Console.print("Hello world!"); //Similer to C# and easier to understand for other programmers :D
```
<br>

## (Proposed) New 🤢🤮

```C#
    Console Print "Hello";
    //WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?!?!?
```

### Now below I have remade the "New" syntax into a better version of the Old syntax while being less worse than the New syntax
<br>

## (Updated) Final 🤔

```C#
    Console.Print("Hello world!");
```
