Easy14 is a simple C# based programming/scripting language for Windows (and other platforms)

This language was made for fun originally but now is a real thing :)

If you just want to get to the point, here it is;

```C#
Console.Print("Hello, World!");
```

There we go

```
// * As of Version 1 - Whale
//Who needs to add using namespaces when you can just reference them everytime you need a function XD :D :| :_(

Console.Print("Hello from the other client!");
Console.Print("I must have CALLED a thousand times!");
//Get it, CALLED? because you are calling the function hahahahahahahahhahahahaahahah yes
Console.Print("To tell you, that im sorry");
Console.Print("For every commit that ive done");

```
