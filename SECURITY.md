## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!--- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. -->

If a bug is found, please report it in issues, if you want to, you can also email me (though i dont look at my inbox alot)
If a problem related to compatablity is found, please report it

## IMPORTANT
Make sure you have C# is installed to use this app (programming language)!

| Operation system  | Supported |
| ----------------  | --------- |
|  Windows 10/11    |    🙂✔️  |
|  Windows 7        |    😦❌ (.NET 6 & .NET 7 not supported on Windows 7) |
|  Mac OS           |    😞❌  | 
|  Linux            |    😞❌  |
|  └─ Ubuntu        |    😞❌  |
|  └─ Debian        |    😞❌  |

The Operating system's mentioned here are the ones i want to support and other operating systems won't be supported because this (programming) language is not really widespread and useful

Note for windows 7, i will make versions for them using .net 5 but some features wont be avaliable due to an older runtime
