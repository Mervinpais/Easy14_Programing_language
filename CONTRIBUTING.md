![Contributing can help me continue my Project](Images\Contribution_Image1.png)
Contributing to this project can help me finish off work that i can't solve, example there is a security bug and i'm asleep, if you can, you can patch the bug and notify me about the bug and the patch you mnade so i know you have atleast helpped in fixing the bugs in the project

## What to do if a contributer added some malicious code
Better to first reprot to the user to me and tell what has changged, and i will fix the code and check if the user had malicious intent of adding the code/not and report them if so
### OR
Report the user to github by yourself and (try) fix the code, this may/not be the best option as you dont rely on me having to respond on your report

Thanks for reading :)
