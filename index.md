# Easy 14 (or E14)
An easy language for begginers?! wOW iTs NoT lIkE pYthOn EiXsTs (seriously though, try python first, it may be easier than this, this language is if you wanted to, say go from python to C# or C or even C++)

## Code Example
```C#
//Syntax highlighted code block
Console.print("You cant use a print statement without a Console. if you didn't import the Console");

using Console;

print("Hello Coders! or whatever that funny starter Hello world stater project said..");
```

# FAQ
## Will This language support One-Liner Code?
No sadly i wont do that as my language does the "Scratch" way of execution by running from top to down and you can't have other lines(statments) within one line

I Might add it later, there is/was some code still left over from an attempt in the Console.Print if statment ;)

## Will this be a general purpose language?

Not yet, there are still bugs needed to be fixed before it because general purpose

## What is the syntax for loops?

```C#
if condition {
  //Code
}
```
though i may add () in the condition part, im just too focued on fixing bugs first
