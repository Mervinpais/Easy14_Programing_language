## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a bug is found, please report it in issues, if you want to, you can also email me (though i dont look at my inbox alot)
If a problem related to compatablity is found, please report it

## IMPORTANT
Make sure you have C# is installed to use this app (programming language)!

| Operation system  | Supported |
| ----------------  | --------- |
|  Windows 10/11    |    🙂✔️  |
|  Windows 7        |    😦❌ (.NET 6 & .NET 7 not supported on Windows 7) |
|  Mac OS           |    😞❌  | 
|  Linux            |    🤔❔ (Note that some features are windows only, in C#, so there may be bugs for linux)  |

The Operating system's mentioned here are the ones i want to support and other operating systems won't be supported because this (programming) language is not really widespread and useful

<s>Note for windows 7, i will make versions for them using .net 5 but some features wont be avaliable due to an older runtime</s>

Windows 7 support will be gone, Rest In Peace, Beloved Windows 7 🪦

## No!

Windows 7 Support WILL be there, we just will take time to support it, as we need to work on the language before porting it to .NET 5 for it to work, but the ports will be avaliable after each major update
