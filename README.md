# Main Stuff
Here is what you need to know

* This is just like any other high level language
* Runs on C#

<hr>

# Version 1.2

The Cool Stuff and Bugfixs arrived,

* Fixed bugs with functions (many 'functions' aka statements were fixed)
* Optimised a bit of the code
* METHODS! (Parameters are not yet there, please wait till version 1.3 or 1.4) Example;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;func methodName() { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("This was printed from a method!"); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;methodName();

# Known Issues

- When using a while/if statement inside another if/while statement, the whole code bugs out and just does whatever example;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if condition == "true" { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if condition2 == "true" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("yes"); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

### This is Causes major bugs

- A Fix will be coming soon, probably in version 1.3 or 1.4, if not, the bug may be too much to handle

## Another similer bug

- When using an if/while statement inside a method, the if loop has to get whatever is below to continue, and since im so bad at programming (aka "im lazy so i make code without documenting it so i cant understand it later", known as the ILSIMCWDISICUIL condtion) example;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;func methodName() { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if condition2 == "true" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("yes"); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

# Why are there bugs?!
There are many reasons, each for different situations;

A) For Companies;
  1. Lazy Workers
  2. Not paided well workers
  3. Not Clear Instruction
  4. Bad bosses
  5. Sh!t code from 1990 (or any ancient code from 10 years ago)

B) For Independant People
  1. Lazy
  2. Bad Code
  3. Bad Metal State
  4. Not Caring for making the code easy to undestand
  5. Sh!t code  from 1990 (or any ancient code from 10 years ago)

Im more of a B3 and a bit of B4, but you choose yourself, you may need to improve by making the time to learn and code about the language you want to code in.
