# Variables

```csharp
var iAmMe = "Leave me be for im the one within the blackned sea";
```

Thats it, and for referencing you gotta specify 
```csharp
() => 
```
with the 'var' and then the variable name

In the example;

```csharp
var iAmMe = "Leave me be for im the one within the blackned sea";
Console.Print(() => var iAmMe);
```

Thats all
