As per my (bad) memory and testing throughout versions, here is the evolution of the first ever command that would be updated first (for syntax);

(Deprecated Older versions)
version-1, version-1.1, version-1.2, version-1.3:
	
	using Console;
	print();

version-2
Either;
	using Console;
	print();
or
	Console.print();
