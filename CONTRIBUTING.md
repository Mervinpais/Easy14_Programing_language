![Contributing can help me continue my Project](Easy14_Programming_language\Images\Contribution_Image1.png)
Contributing to this project can help me finish off work that i can't solve, example in the case of a 0-Day bug, if you can, you can patch the bug and notify me about the bug and the patch you made so i can review if its good/not

## What to do if a contributer added something bad/malicious
1. Report the user first to prevent them from doing any more damage
2. Revert the code back to the working one
3. Check if it works

Thanks for reading :)
